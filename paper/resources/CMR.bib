  abstract = {We analyze incomplete long-term financial contracts between an entrepreneur with no initial wealth and a wealthy investor. Both agents have potentially conflicting objectives since the entrepreneur cares about both pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns from the project while the investor is only concerned about monetary returns. We address the questions of (i) whether and how the initial contract can be structured in such a way as to bring about a perfect coincidence of objectives between both agents (ii) when the initial contract cannot achieve this coincidence of objectives how should control rights be allocated to achieve efficiency? One of the main results of our analysis concerns the optimality properties of the (contingent) control allocation induced by standard debt financing.},

Examining 14,940 contracts, we document significant heterogeneity in the use and size of ownership caps, which limit large equity block-formation. Lenders set lower caps to mitigate risks arising from power contests among shareholders, takeover threats, and coordination costs within the syndicate. Setting caps below 50\% is associated with a drop in firm value, but not in the cost of debt, consistent with exacerbated firm-manager agency costs. Finally, largest block size increases when these restrictions expire, shedding new light on ways creditors may influence corporate governance.},

We hypothesize and document that when a borrower's accounting information possesses higher DCV, information asymmetry between the lead arranger and other syndicate participants is lower, allowing lead arrangers to hold a smaller proportion of new loan deals. Further, we document that the influence of DCV on the proportion of the loan retained is conditional on the lead arranger's reputation, the existence of a credit rating, and the lead arranger's previous relationships with the same borrower. Finally, we find that when loans include performance pricing provisions, the likelihood that the single performance measure used is an accounting ratio, rather than a credit rating, is increasing in DCV.},

CPS also has a rich set of relations with firms' behavior and performance. In particular, CPS is correlated with lower (industry-adjusted) accounting profitability, lower stock returns accompanying acquisitions announced by the firm and higher likelihood of a negative stock return accompanying such announcements, higher odds of the {CEO} receiving a lucky option grant at the lowest price of the month, lower performance sensitivity of {CEO} turnover, and lower stock market returns accompanying the filing of proxy statements for periods when CPS increases.

Building on the work of Jensen and Meckling [1976, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs, and Captial Structure, Journal of the Financial Economics 3, 305\textendash{}360], Myers [1977, Determinants of Corporate Borrowing, Journal of Financial Economics 5, 145\textendash{}147] and Smith and Warner [1979, On Financial Contracting: An Analysis of Bond Covenants, Journal of Financial Economics 7(2), 117\textendash{}161]. We summarize and test the implications for what we refer to as the Agency Theory of Covenants (ATC), using a large sample of privately placed corporate debt. Our results are consistent with many of the implications of the ATC, including a negative relation between the promised yield on corporate debt and the presence of covenants. We also find that borrower and lender characteristics, as well as macroeconomic factors, determine covenant structure. Loans are more likely to include protective covenants when the borrower is small, has high growth opportunities or is highly levered. Loans made by investment banks and syndicated loans are also more likely to include protective covenants, as are loans made during recessionary periods or when credit spreads are large. Finally, we show that consistent with the ATC, firms that elect to issue private rather than public debt are smaller, have greater growth opportunities, less long-term debt, fewer tangible assets, more volatile cash flows and include more covenants in their debt agreements. An important byproduct of our analysis is to demonstrate empirically that covenant structure and the yield on corporate debt are determined simultaneously.},

Moreover, the borrower׳s post-renegotiation investment and financial policies are strongly associated with the covenant changes resulting from the renegotiation.

A key result is that borrowers with credit ratings toward the middle of the spectrum rely on bank loans, and in periods of high interest rates or low future profitability, higher-rated borrowers choose to borrow from banks.},

Using a sample of U.S. equity REITs from 2001 to 2016, we find that total compensation of REIT top executives is positively correlated with the lagged firm risk measures, even after controlling for managerial entrenchment proxies. These results are consistent with principal-agent theory and suggest that exogenous firm risk is an important determinant of REIT executive compensation in the cross-section. Additional analysis based on the correlation between compensation components and firm risks show that, REITs tend to compensate their executives for risk mainly through cash compensation, instead of equity-based compensation. The latter finding supports the notion that REIT top executives, who are often required with specific real estate knowledge and experience, demand higher short-term compensation for bearing extra risk. Taken together, this paper sheds light on the recent REIT executive compensation reform and provides new evidence on the debate about the pay and risk relationship in the literature.},

This effect was most pronounced during the 1980s, when greater competition and relatively less-stringent regulation increased the severity of moral hazard problems in the US banking industry.

One, a REIT has to satisfy special regulations which weaken alternative mechanisms to control agency problems. Empirically, I find a significant and robust nonlinear relation between Tobin's Q and REIT insider ownership that is consistent with the trade-off between the incentive alignment and the entrenchment effect of insider ownership. Two, many REITs are Umbrella Partnership REITs (UPREITs) which have dual ownership structure. They have both common shares and Operating Partnership Units (OP units). Property owners can contribute their properties to the UPREIT in exchange for OP units. Their capital gains taxes remain deferred as long as they hold onto their OP units and the UPREIT does not sell the properties they contributed. OP units owners are locked in with the firm and have incentive to monitor firm management, but their interests diverge from the common shareholders because their tax bases are much lower. Consistent with the trade-off between positive monitoring effect of OP units and tax-induced agency costs, I find that UPREIT's firm value increases with the fraction of OP units, but the effect is significantly weaker for the UPREITs where insiders hold OP units.},

Our results do not support the view that the convexity inherent in option-based compensation is used to reduce risk-related agency problems between managers and shareholders. We show that all firms dramatically reduce their usage of stock options (convexity) after the adoption of FAS 123R and that the decline in option use is strongly associated with a proxy for accounting costs. Little evidence exists that the decline in option usage following the accounting change results in less risky investment and financial policies. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In equilibrium, however, the asymmetric information premium demanded by participants is offset by the diversification premium demanded by the lead. Using shifts in the idiosyncratic credit risk of the lead bank's loan portfolio as an instrument, I measure the asymmetric information effect of the lead's share on the loan spread and find that it accounts for approximately 4\% of the total cost of credit.},

In the more recent period since 2000, total {CEO} turnover increases to 16.8\%, implying an average tenure of less than 6 years. Internal turnover is significantly related to three components of firm stock performance \textendash{} performance relative to industry, industry performance relative to the overall market, and the performance of the overall stock market. The relations are stronger in the more recent period since 2000.

We show that the sample used by Billett, Flannery, and Garfinkel (1995) fails to represent the loan universe and that significant abnormal announcement returns are confined to their smallest firms. Our sample, which better represents the loan population, produces an abnormal return insignificantly different from zero. The findings suggest that self-selection bias affects extant loan announcement research and do not support the views that loans are a special form of finance or that private and public debt differ in significant ways. Were all loans to be announced, the average abnormal return would likely be insignificant.},

The accrual of new information concerning the credit quality, investment opportunities, and collateral of the borrower, as well as macroeconomic fluctuations in credit and equity market conditions, are the primary determinants of renegotiation and its outcomes. The terms of the initial contract (e.g., contingencies) also play an important role in renegotiations; by altering the structure of the contract in a state contingent manner, renegotiation is partially controlled by the contractual assignment of bargaining power.},

The cycle of equity participation in alliances resembles what we observe in venture capital contracts: they involve convertible equity and sometimes contain antidilution provisions, warrants, and board seats. Contracts rights vary explicitly with the size of the equity stake. Contracts contain explicit provisions linking equity participation to subsequent initial public offerings and contain clauses designed to insulate both parties from multitasking problems. Contracts often specify provisions that are unobservable or difficult to verify, which suggests a role for expected litigation as an enforcement tool in contract design.},

  abstract = {I empirically explore the syndicated loan market, with an emphasis on how information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers influences syndicate structure and on which lenders become syndicate members. Consistent with moral hazard in monitoring, the lead bank retains a larger share of the loan and forms a more concentrated syndicate when the borrower requires more intense monitoring and due diligence. When information asymmetry between the borrower and lenders is potentially severe, participant lenders are closer to the borrower, both geographically and in terms of previous lending relationships. Lead bank and borrower reputation mitigates, but does not eliminate information asymmetry problems.},

  abstract = {According to my new and extensive data on all US public companies, the majority of them have multiple blockholders (large shareholders). These blockholders could differ along several characteristics even within one company. Diversity between blockholders within a firm could have a positive and synergistic impact on its value. Alternatively, conflicting objectives and interests may cause diversity to adversely impact company operations. To investigate the resulting impact of blockholders diversity on company value, I construct diversity measures reflecting their heterogeneity in identity, portfolio size and investment horizon. Using shocks from blockholder acquisitions of financial firms and unexpected increases in payouts they receive from other positions to identify the causality channel, I find that block diversity has a strong negative influence on company value and operations. This result is robust to a variety of specifications and to exclusion of different groups of blockholders. Additionally, simulated placebo tests reject alternative explanations related to other observed and unobserved characteristics of block ownership.},
